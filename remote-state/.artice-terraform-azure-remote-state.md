# Terraform Remote State on Azure

### Introduction
Cloud computing and infrastructure-as-code are transforming the way we manage and deploy resources in the IT world. Among the leading tools in this revolution is Terraform. In this post, we'll delve into setting up Terraform with remote state management within an Azure subscription, ensuring a smooth and scalable infrastructure management experience.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Terraform:
Before diving into Azure, ensure you have Terraform installed. Download the appropriate package from the Terraform website and install it.
Explanation: Terraform is a command-line tool, so you need to have it locally installed to run commands against your Azure resources.

2. Azure CLI Installation:
Ensure the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is installed. This tool interacts directly with Azure services.
Explanation: While Terraform will handle most tasks, the Azure CLI allows for additional configuration and verification tasks.

3. Authenticate Terraform with Azure:
Before Terraform can manage resources in Azure, it needs permissions. Use the Azure CLI to log in:


```

az -login

```

A browser will oben and you have to loggin to azure. Noteice in the terminal the list of available subscribtions. Copy the ID of the subscribtion you want to use.
Noe set the subscribtion:

```

az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>

```

You can verify the actual setting with `az account show`

4. Create Service Principal:
Now we have to create a Service Principal. A SP is an application in Azure Active Directory (AAD), which will provide the authorization tokens Terraform need ot perform actions on your behalf.

```

az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --role="Contributor" \ 
    --scopes="/subscription/<your-subscription-id> 

```

It is recommended to NOT safe the provided credentials in any terrafrom script, so we will export them as enviroment variables and store them in a hidden file on the console.
Keep in mind, that evyryone who has acces to your local console could as well read these variables. So for a production environment this would not be a preffered aporach. For any production environment i would recommend to store these variables in a key vault, but this is out of scope for now.

5. Set Environment Variables

Set the following enviroment variables and store then in a .secrets file. You can source them afterwards easoly by `source .secrets`. 
Create a new hidden secrets file in the actual folder:

```
nano .secrets

```
Copy the following export into the new file, replaye the placeholders with your actual values and save the file (`CTRL/Control + O + y`).

```

export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<your-app-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-client-secret>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscriptionid>"
export ARM_TENAND_ID="<your-tenant-id>"

```

Activate ethe settings by typing `source .secrets`in the terminal

### Terraform cconfiguration

We now have to create a couple of terraform declaration files. In theory it would be possible to place everything despite the variable definionts in one file but for readability and modularity reasons we will place the ddeclarations in separate files. Create the follwoing empty files with you preferred code editor:

main.tf
resourcegroups.tf
variables.tf
storage.tf
remotestate.tfvars

We now have to setup an inital `main.tf` file which will hold the terraform provider information. Place the follwoiung coide in your main.tf file and safe it:


```
# main.tf
# configuration of azure provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      # version = "~>3.6.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

```

Next we will define a file for variable declaration and for resource groups. Let's start with the variable definiitons.

copy the follwoing code into your variable.tf file:


```
# varibales.tf
## All variable definitions will go here

variable "sbx_resgroup_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The resurcegroup for state file storage account"
}

variable "sbx_default_location" {
  type        = string
  description = "default location used for managemtn assets (mostly westeurope)"
}

variable "sbx_tf-storage-account" {
  type        = string
  description = "storage account used for terraform backend state"
}

```

Create a new file resourcegroups.tf and  place the definition of  new resource groups for holding the storage-account we will use for remote state in thre upcomig steps:

resourcegroups.tf:

```
# resource group declarations

#resorcegroup for remotestate



```

auto.tfvars:
```

# remotestate.tfvars
# 
# Any variable definition in same scope defined by variable "xyz" {} 
# can be initialized here

# Default Resource Group
sbx_resgroup_name = "<your-resourcegroup-name"

# Default location 
sbx_default_location = "<your preferred location>"


# Storage account for terraform state file
sbx_tf_storage_account = "<your-worldwide-unique-storage-account>"


```

With everything in place we can no start a first initialisation and createion of the resourcegroup which will hold the storage account for our state file.

```

terraform fmt 
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan

terraform apply 

```
With  `terraform show` you can check the current setup.


#### Storage Account

In next step you'll have to configure a storage account in which terrafrom can store your state file.
Create a file named storage.tf and paste the follwoing code:

```

# Create a storage account to store the central Terraform state.
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "tfstateac" {
  name                      = var.sbx_tf_storage_account # Name of the storage account, provided as a variable.
  resource_group_name       = var.sbx_resgroup_name      # Name of the resource group, provided as a variable.
  location                  = var.sbx_default_location   # Location where the storage account will be created, provided as a variable.
  account_tier              = "Standard"                 # Specifies the performance and redundancy of the storage account.
  account_replication_type  = "LRS"                      # Specifies the type of replication to be used for data redundancy.
  enable_https_traffic_only = true                       # Enforces HTTPS-only access to the storage account.

  # Note: Additional settings like network rules, encryption, etc. can be configured here.
}

# Define a blob container within the storage account to store the Terraform backend state.
resource "azurerm_storage_container" "tfstate" {
  name                  = "terraformstate"           # Name of the blob container for storing the Terraform state.
  storage_account_name  = var.sbx_tf_storage_account # Name of the storage account, provided as a variable.
  container_access_type = "private"                  # Specifies the access level for the blob container.

  # Note: You can configure access policies, lifecycle management, and other container settings here.
}


```

Again run `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`and a `terraform apply` - this will create the storage account and blobcontainer to hold required to store the state file.

## moving from loval state to remote state

In the main.tf add the following lines to the main.tf:

```

backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "<your-resource-group>"
    storage_account_name = "<your-storage-account>"
    container_name       = "terraformstate"
    key                  = "terraform/sbx/state"
  }


```
This hast to be planed inside the terraform{} block on the same indentation as required_providers{} 

Final main.tf:

```

backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "<your-resource-group>"
    storage_account_name = "<your-storage-account>"
    container_name       = "terraformstate"
    key                  = "terraform/sbx/state"
  }


```

As last step you now have to initialize Terraform again

```

terraform init


```

You have to approve ('yes') to have your state file moved to the azure backend.


That's it - you're done. your rterraform state is no independent form your local machine. Other team mates now could carr out Infrastructutre as code task with terraform as well (given thei gve proer access right ;)

.p.s:
If you want to clean up the sanbox enviroment again: with 'terraform destroy' everything we've created above will be deleted...
